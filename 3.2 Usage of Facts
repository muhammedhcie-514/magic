Step 1 Extract all facts.
There are numerous facts. Before extracting them, run the following command to export
all facts to a text file using the setup module for easier searching:
[root@controller yaml]# ansible servera -m setup > servera.txt
Step 2 Search for IP address information.
Skim the servera.txt file, and you can see IP addresses are displayed in
ansible_all_ipv4_addresses, ansible_default_ipv4, and ipv4.

"ansible_fact": { 
  'ansible_all_ipv4_addresses": [
        "172.16.0.12",
        "10.0.1.12"
],

'ansible_default_ipv4": {
"address": "172.16.0.12",
"alias": "ens3",
"broadcast": "172.16.0.255"
"gateway": "172.16.0.1",
"interface": "ens3",
"macaddress": "fa:16:3e:43:33:3f"
"mtu": 1500,
"netmask": "255.255.255.0",
"network": "172.16.0.0",
"type": "ether"
},

"hw_timestamp_filters": [],
'ipv4": {
"address": "10.0.1.12",
"broadcast": "10.0.1.255",
"netmask": "255.255.255.0"
"network": "10.0.1.0"
}

"hw_timestamp_filters": [],
"ipv4": {
"address": "172.16.0.12",
"broadcast": "172.16.0.255",
"netmask": "255.255.255.0",
"network": "172.16.0.0"
}

ansible_all_ipv4_addresses cannot map IP addresses to NICs, and ansible_default_ipv4
cannot display all IP addresses. Therefore, only ipv4 can be used. The value of address in
ipv4 is the IP address. The upper level of ipv4 is ansible_xxxx, where xxxx indicates the
NIC name. The upper level of ansible_xxxx is ansible_facts. Therefore, the fact used in
this example is ansible_xxxx.ipv4.address.

Step 3 Conduct a test.
Write a playbook as follows and invoke the fact determined in step 2 to test whether the
requirements can be met.
- hosts: servera
 gather_facts: true
 tasks:
 - debug:
 msg: "ip address of enp4s4 is {{ ansible_enp4s4.ipv4.address}}"
 - debug:
 msg: "ip address of ens3 is {{ ansible_ens3.ipv4.address }}"
Execute the playbook to obtain the following information.
ansible-playbook fact.yml

⚫ Question: Can gather_facts not be configured in the playbook in step 3?
⚫ Answer: If gather_facts can collect facts by default in the configuration file, you do
not need to set it; otherwise, you must set it to true or yes.
⚫ Task: Select appropriate facts to obtain the capacity of a partition.
⚫ Reference: Use ansible_devices.vda.partitions.vda1.size to read the capacity of
partition vda1.
