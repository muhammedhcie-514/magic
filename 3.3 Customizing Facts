Example: Add a fact for servera and serverb and set usage to test.
Step 1 Create required files on the controlled host.
To customize environment variables, create an /etc/ansible/facts.d directory on the
controlled host and import the defined facts as the x.fact file. Create a usage.fact file on
the controlled host as follows.
[usage]
name=test
Write a playbook to create the required directory and copy the created usage.fact file to
the controlled hosts.
- hosts: all
 tasks:
 - name: mkdir dir
 file:
 state: directory
 path: /etc/ansible/facts.d
 - name: upload file
 copy:
src: /root/yaml/usage.fact
 dest: /etc/ansible/facts.d/usage.fact

Step 2 Conduct a test.
Run the following command to check whether the customized facts take effect:
[root@controller yaml]# ansible all -m setup -a "filter=ansible_local"

⚫ Question: Can filter of the setup module be used to accurately filter a user-defined
fact?
⚫ Answer: No. filter of the setup module can read only the lower layer of
ansible_facts.
