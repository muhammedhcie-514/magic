3.4.1 Usage of hostvars
Example: Check other variables except facts of servera.
Write a playbook as follows:
- hosts: servera
 remote_user: root
gather_facts: false
 tasks:
 - name: hostvars
 debug:
 msg: "{{ hostvars['servera'] }}"
The output is as follows.
ansible-playbook hostvar.yml

⚫ Question: Can the host in the playbook be specified as serverb?
⚫ Answer: Yes. Modify as required.
⚫ Question: Why does servera need to be specified in msg: "{{ hostvars['servera'] }}"?
What happens if it is not specified?
⚫ Answer: The variables related to servera need to be obtained. Therefore, servera is
specified in hostvars. If servera is not specified, variables related to all hosts in the
host list are displayed.
